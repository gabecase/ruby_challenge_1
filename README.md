Subject: String manipulation, Collection equality

Getting your project to run:

1. git clone this project into a directory
2. cd into that directory
3. run command `bundle install`
4. execute command `rake test` when your prepared to execute the tests


Fix the method `is_permutation?` defined in the StringHelper class to figure out if two strings are a permutation of each other, return true if they are and return false if not. Create your own branch and push your solution on that branch.

There are 4 unit tests that are going to test your code, the tests are currently failing but are valid test cases. This is what is known as a RED-GREEN refactor in Test Driven Development, we start with valid test cases that demonstrate the desired functionality.
These tests will fail since the code is missing, you now need to refactor the code in order to make the tests pass.

Run all the tests by executing `rake test`

Once all the tests pass your code is good. Code will be evaluated on efficiency (Big O notation) as well as readability, your code needs to handle edge cases as well and will have additional test cases run against it. You can also add more tests if you want to.
